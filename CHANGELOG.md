# Changelog

## 2.3.0 [2025-12-xx]

This version introduce setup to improve compatibility and bundle size reduction. If you have made
use of `logger`, you must now include `setupLogger(new Logger())` on entrypoint or not at all if you
prefer no log and use `getLogger()` to use current logger. You may also use third-party or build-in
logging provided you wrap around Logger.

File restructured to be more streamlined and coupled to existing context. Most `types` has been
moved to their respective location. For end-user, if you have made use of `types` you may only
require to do minimal change.

```

## 2.0.0 [2024-07-23]

```diff
+ Collider environment & color scheme
+ `read` and `write` module
  +  This is to separate loading and saving functionality from including `fs`
+ `Beatmap` class object
  + Contains both `Difficulty` and `Lightshow`, separating respective object to supposed category
  + Loading and saving will now use `Beatmap` object rather than individual class above
  + `customData` under `Beatmap` will be placed onto but not replacing existing `customData` object in `Difficulty` and `Lightshow` upon save
+ Compatibility check on save
+ Several beatmap helpers
+ Gaussian random using Box-Muller transform utils function
* Complete overhaul on beatmap structure
  * Now version agnostic, no need to create from version-specific object
  * This follows much closer to how beatmap is processed in-game than what it is in format
  * Customizable and arbitrary version format
    * For simplicity sake, only counts major version, but not limited to single digit
  * Implicit Mapping Extensions conversion
    * Mapping extensions is not recommended to be used as it is highly dependent on map format and the module tries its best to interpret Mapping Extensions as close to plugin beatmap processing
* `BeatPerMinute` class renamed to `TimeProcessor`
- Several leftover/dead code that could lead to confusion
- Default value and deep copy omitted when deserialize
  - This will instead be done inside `core` beatmap
```
